# Data Preprocessing 

Preprocessing means getting your raw data ready so that a machine learning model (or any data analysis) can actually understand and use it.

Raw data often has problems ‚Äî it can be messy, incomplete, or in the wrong format.Preprocessing is like cleaning, organizing, and transforming your data before feeding it into your model.


# Common Steps in Preprocessing 

Cleaning ‚Äì Removing or fixing bad data
Example: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting spelling errors.

Normalization/Scaling ‚Äì Bringing all numbers to a similar range
Example: Converting ages like 5, 25, 70 into 0.07, 0.35, 1.0 so large numbers don‚Äôt dominate the model.

Encoding Categorical Data ‚Äì Converting words into numbers
Example: Turning ["Red", "Green", "Blue"] into [0, 1, 2] or one-hot encoding.

Splitting Data ‚Äì Dividing into training and testing sets
Example: 80% of data to train the model, 20% to test it.

# Analogy

Think of preprocessing like washing and chopping vegetables before cooking:
Raw vegetables (data) are dirty, uneven, and full of inedible parts.
You wash, peel, cut, and organize them so the chef (your ML model) can cook a perfect dish.
If you skip this step, your final meal (model performance) will suffer.

# Assignment 1

The goal is to practice data preprocessing using the Titanic dataset with pandas, numpy, and sklearn.
You‚Äôll need to:

-Load the dataset from the given URL.
-Handle missing values (fill or drop them appropriately).
-Deal with duplicate rows.
-Convert categorical columns (like Sex and Embarked) into numerical form using label encoding.
-Normalize numerical features (like Age and Fare).
-Sort and filter data (e.g., by Fare or Age).
-Engineer a new feature (like an AgeGroup column).
-(Optional) Create visualizations (e.g., survival count plot, fare distribution histogram).


## üìå Quick Flow of Lab 1
1. **Load Data** ‚Üí Get Titanic CSV into pandas DataFrame.
2. **Inspect Data** ‚Üí Check missing values & duplicates.
3. **Clean Data** ‚Üí Fill missing values, remove duplicates.
4. **Select Features** ‚Üí Drop unused columns.
5. **Encode Categories** ‚Üí Convert text to numbers with `LabelEncoder`.
6. **Scale Numbers** ‚Üí Use `StandardScaler` to normalize.
7. **Engineer Features** ‚Üí Create `AgeGroup` with `pd.cut()`.
8. **Visualize** ‚Üí Plot survival count with seaborn.



## üõ† Tools & Memory Tricks

| Tool | One-Liner Definition | Memory Trick |
|------|----------------------|--------------|
| **pandas (`pd`)** | Library to handle **tables** of data (DataFrames). | Think: **Excel in Python** |
| **numpy (`np`)** | Handles fast **math & arrays**. | Think: **Math engine behind pandas** |
| **LabelEncoder** | Turns **categories ‚Üí numbers**. | Think: *Name tags become ID numbers* |
| **StandardScaler** | Rescales numbers ‚Üí mean 0, std 1. | Think: **Put all players at same height** before the match |
| **matplotlib (`plt`)** | Creates **basic plots & graphs**. | Think: *Draw anything from scratch* |
| **seaborn (`sns`)** | Creates **beautiful, easy graphs** built on matplotlib. | Think: *Matplotlib but with makeup* |
| **`np.inf`** | Infinity value for ranges. | Think: **Never-ending number** |
| **`pd.cut()`** | Turns continuous numbers into **categories**. | Think: **Put ages into buckets** (‚Äúchild‚Äù, ‚Äúadult‚Äù) |
| **`.fillna()`** | Fills missing values with a chosen number. | Think: **Patch the holes** in data |
| **`.drop_duplicates()`** | Removes repeated rows. | Think: **Delete photocopies** |
